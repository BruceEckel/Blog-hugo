# BruceEckel.com Blog

Using Hugo-Octopress, deployed with Netlify.

To create a new post:

```
hugo new post/<title>.md
```

Once you're finished editing, deploy using Github desktop.

Netlify builds the site automatically, so the only reason to run Hugo locally
is to check the post for errors:

```
hugo
```
