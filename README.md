# BruceEckel.com Blog

Using Hugo-Octopress, deployed with Netlify.

To create a new post:

```
hugo new post/<title>.md
```

Once you're finished editing, deploy using Github desktop.

Netlify builds the site automatically, so the only reason to run the `hugo` command locally
is to check the post for errors.

To test the site locally, run `local.bat`.
