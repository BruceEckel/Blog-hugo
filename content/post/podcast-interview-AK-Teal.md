A recent interview with
[The Six Figure Developer](https://6figuredev.com/%20podcast/episode-111-atomic-kotlin-and-teal-orgs-with-bruce-eckel/)
podcast. I talk about how much I'm enjoying the design of Kotlin while writing
[Atomic Kotlin](https://www.atomickotlin.com/) and also my experiment with
creating a "Teal" software consulting firm.
