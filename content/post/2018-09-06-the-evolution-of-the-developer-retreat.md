title: The Evolution of the Developer Retreat

I've been experimenting with different forms of events for many years now.
Mostly this has been in the form of self-organizing conferences, but in recent
years I've tried going further, to even less structure. I've held a number of
"developer retreats" where we had a theme that everyone focused on, and those
have been quite interesting and valuable.

To be honest, what I *really* wanted to try with the developer retreats is zero
structure. People just get together and individually work on whatever they
want. And then see what happens. However, I could never quite bring myself to
suggest such a flaky-sounding experiment.

But the week of August 19-25, it happened anyway. And it was great.

For various different reasons (probably mostly because I seem to be bad at
promoting events), neither the Kotlin seminar nor the Software Architecture
Forum were working out. However,
[Luciano Ramalho](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/luciano-ramalho-on-pythons-features-and-libraries)
and one other person had made plans and still wanted to come, so I decided to
call it a developer retreat, but one where we made up the theme during the
retreat.

As it turned out, we each had things we wanted to work on (for some people,
this included their job), so we did, and we never established a central theme.
This meant that we ended up exploring many more topics than in previous
retreats, because some explorations didn't take very long, or didn't pan out or
weren't interesting enough, so we went on to other topics. But I'm saying this
as if we studied each topic as a group, which wasn't the case. Each person
worked on their own experiments and we would sometimes have discussions about
these. For me, it was the best developer retreat experience I've had---the
relaxation and freedom to do whatever you want, but with other people around
with whom you could discuss and share.

We also ended up spending most of the working time in the new co-working space
that I've been setting up, called [Evolve](http://www.evolvework.co/) (The web
site is not live yet).

Among the topics we explored and discussed:

+ **Kotlin**: The working environment ispired me to make quite a bit of
progress on [Atomic Kotlin](http://atomickotlin.com/), and this produced some
discussions about the language.

+ **Elixir**: Luciano was delving into Elixir (and preparing to take a workshop
at the upcoming ElixirConf), so we had discussions about the way Elixir was
designed, and its roots in Erlang.

+ **Flutter**: Another member of the group dove into Flutter and within a short
time had a simple app working on his Android phone, with plans to try it on
his iOS device. I was skeptical at first because my initial experience with the
Dart language left me nonplussed, but Dart has evolved quite significantly since
then and I'd say it's roughly 1/3 of the way between Java and Kotlin; which is
to say: much nicer to use than Java. And the Flutter framework itself might
just be one of the actual solutions to single-source development across Android
and iOS.

+ **Ubuntu on Windows**: We discovered that Ubuntu is now an app in the Windows
10 app store, and can be installed and used effortlessly (vs. the earlier
experimental version, which required some hoop-jumping to get up and running).
This makes Windows 10 even more attractive for development.

+ **Games**: There were some side discussions and demos of some interesting
new games, and about the game world in general.

+ **Testing**: We had some good testing conversations and Q&As, in particular
for Django-based web apps.

Although the full-group explorations that we've done in the past---studying a
chosen topic, in my living room, sharing the TV screen using Chromecast---might
well have a place in this new model of the developer retreat, I suspect that it
might comprise only a shorter and occasional portion, if it even happens. My
own experience during previous developer retreats is that this format became
onerous and restrictive after awhile, and exhausting after multiple days.
Indeed, developer retreats were formerly limited to four days because it became
too intense for a longer period, while this new relaxed format easily worked
for a week.

So, until even better insights come along, this is the new format for developer
retreats:

+ Most of it happens at the co-working space.
+ People do whatever they want, including work projects when they need to.
+ Occasionally someone starts a discussion about what they've found or where they're stuck.
+ Meals offer further opportunity for discussion.
+ We can go for outdoor adventures as weather permits.
+ If a group exploration seems appropriate, we can do that, but only for as
long as it works well.

This format is also more flexible for people's schedules---if someone can't
make it for the whole event, they can still get a lot of value if they are only
there part of the time.
