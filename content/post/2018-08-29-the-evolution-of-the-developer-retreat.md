I've been experimenting with different forms of events for many years now.
Mostly this has been in the form of self-organizing conferences, but in
recent years I've tried going further, to even less organization. I've
held a number of "developer retreats" where we had a theme that everyone
focused on, and those have been quite interesting and valuable.

To be honest, what I *really* wanted to try with the developer retreats is
zero structure. People just get together and individually work on whatever
they want. And then see what happens. However, I could never bring myself to
suggest such a flaky-sounding experiment.

But the week of August 19-25, it happened anyway. And it was great.

For various different reasons (probably mostly because I seem to be bad at
promoting events), neither the Kotlin seminar nor the Software Architecture
Forum were working out. However,
[Luciano Ramalho](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/luciano-ramalho-on-pythons-features-and-libraries)
and one other person had made plans and still wanted to come, so I decided to
call it a developer retreat, but one where we made up the theme during the
retreat.

As it turned out, we each had things we wanted to work on (for some people,
this included their job), so we did, and we never established a central theme.
This meant that we ended up trying many more things than in previous retreats,
because some explorations didn't take very long, or didn't pan out or weren't
interesting enough, so we went on to other topics. But I'm saying this as if we
studied each topic as a group, which wasn't the case. Each person worked on
their own experiments and we would regularly discuss one or the other. For me,
it was the best developer retreat experience I've had---the freedom to do
whatever you want, but with other people around with whom you could discuss and
share.

We also ended up spending most of the working time in the new co-working space
that I've been setting up, called [Evolve](www.EvolveWork.co) (The web site is
not live yet).

Here are some of the topics we explored and/or discussed:

+ **Kotlin**:
+ **Elixir**:
+ **Flutter**:
+ **Ubuntu on Windows**:
+ **Games**:
+ **Testing**: in particular for Django-based web apps

Although the full-group explorations that we've done in the past---studying a
chosen topic, in my living room, sharing the TV screen using Chromecast---might
well have a place in this new model of the developer retreat, I suspect that
it might comprise only a shorter and occasional portion, if it even happens.
My own experience during previous developer retreats is that this format became
onerous and restrictive after awhile, and exhausting after multiple days. Indeed,
developer retreats were formerly limited to four days because it became too
intense for a longer period, while this new relaxed format easily worked for
a week.

So, until new and even better insights come along, this is the new format
for developer retreats:
+ Most of it happens at the co-working space.
+ People do whatever they want, including work projects when they need to.
+ Occasionally someone starts a discussion about what they've found or where they're stuck.
+ Meals offer further opportunity for discussion.
+ We can go for outdoor adventures as weather permits.
+ If a group exploration seems appropriate, we can do that, but only for as
long as it works well.

This format is also more flexible for people's schedules---if someone can't
make it for the whole event, they can still get a lot of value if they are only
there part of the time.
