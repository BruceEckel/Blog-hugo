I've been experimenting with different forms of events for many years now.
Mostly this has been in the form of self-organizing conferences, but in
recent years I've tried going further out to even less organization. I've
held a number of "developer retreats" where we had a theme that everyone
focused on, and those have been quite interesting and valuable.
