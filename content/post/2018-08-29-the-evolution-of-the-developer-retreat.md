I've been experimenting with different forms of events for many years now.
Mostly this has been in the form of self-organizing conferences, but in
recent years I've tried going further, to even less organization. I've
held a number of "developer retreats" where we had a theme that everyone
focused on, and those have been quite interesting and valuable.

To be honest, what I *really* wanted to try with the developer retreats is
zero structure. People just get together and individually work on whatever
they want. And then see what happens. However, I could never bring myself to
suggest such a flaky-sounding experiment.

But the week of August 19-25, it happened anyway. And it was great.

It happened this way. For various different reasons (probably mostly because I
seem to be bad at promoting events), neither the Kotlin seminar nor the
Software Architecture Forum were working out. However,
[Luciano Ramalho](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/luciano-ramalho-on-pythons-features-and-libraries)
and one other person had made plans and still wanted to come, so I decided to
call it a developer retreat, but one where we made up the theme during the
retreat.

As it turned out, we each had things we wanted to work on (for some people,
this included their job), so we did, and we never established a central theme.
This meant that we ended up trying many more things than in previous retreats,
because some explorations didn't take very long, or didn't pan out or weren't
interesting enough, so we went on to other topics. But I'm saying this as if we
did it in a group, which wasn't the case. Each person worked on their own
experiments and we would regularly discuss one or the other. For me, it was
the best developer retreat experience I've had---the freedom to do whatever you
want, but with other people around with whom you could discuss and share.
