title: Developer Retreats Keep Getting Better

The recent developer retreat took place August 20-26th. We arranged it because
my friend Luciano Ramalho
([Thoughtworker](https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/luciano-ramalho) and
author of the best-selling [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do))
was doing a multi-stop trip to the US (from his native Brazil) and had a gap in
his schedule, so he wanted to come to Crested Butte and have a retreat. This
seems to have become a pattern: someone I know would like to come here, and we
end up organizing a retreat around their trip.

In the past we've had retreats around specific subjects, but I've found that this
created pressure to "move forward" and "be productive" which seems to make the
event more like work and less like a retreat, taking important amounts of fun
and relaxation away. So with each successive retreat I've tried to remove anything
that allows us to fall into our normal mindset of urgency.

Initially, I stated that the only "rule" was the
["law of two feet"](https://www.wintertechforum.com/open-spaces/#the-law-of-two-feet)
which we use during the [Winter Tech Forum](https://www.wintertechforum.com/),
but as the retreat progressed I realized that this is based on the idea of
multiple sessions happening at the same time, and thus "two feet" is confusing
during a developer retreat. So I revised it to the much simpler maxim of "Do whatever
you want." This seemed to be an important clarification. For example, during several
afternoons Luciano comfortably announced that he was going to take a nap (an example
that I followed, having just returned from a rather exhausting workshop myself).

With such a lax structure (indeed, as lax as I've been able to make it), our
cultural training tells us that less would be accomplished, but it seems like
we got a lot done, and there were numerous other learning experiences that
happened along the way. For me, a particularly valuable multi-day conversation
was on coroutines in Python (which also enhanced my research into coroutines
for Kotlin). Both Luciano and Jim Baker were very helpful here, and even though
I've been studying and writing about concurrency on and off for decades, my
understanding took a nice jump forward.

We use Slack as a communication platform during a retreat. This includes basics
like answering questions about travel and lodging, but also things as simple
as announcing that you are heading to a coffee shop or to breakfast in case
other people want to join you. And of course, sharing technical information
about projects.

Luciano wanted to create a foundation for experimenting with the "Distributed
Consensus Problem" (an introduction can be found
[here](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/08/a-generalised-solution-to-distributed-consensus/)),
using the [RAFT algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)---that link includes a simulation
to make it easier to understand.
