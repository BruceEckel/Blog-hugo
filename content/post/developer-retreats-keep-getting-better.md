The recent developer retreat took place August 20-26th. We arranged it because
my friend Luciano Ramalho
([Thoughtworker](https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/luciano-ramalho)  and
author of the best-selling [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do))
was doing a multi-stop trip to the US (from his native Brazil) and had a gap in
his schedule, so he wanted to come to Crested Butte and have a retreat.

This seems to have become a pattern: someone I know would like to come here,
and we end up organizing a retreat around their trip.
